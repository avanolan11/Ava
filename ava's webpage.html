  It was founded in 2014 by Jazz Thornton and Genevieve Mora, both being mental health surviviours they felt the need to voice their past experiences and 
  show others that change is possible. Voices of Hope aims to create and implement change for mental health, while providing hope through the voices of those with previous experiences and providing strategies and content to influence global, communal and individual change.
